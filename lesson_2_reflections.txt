What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

.git metadeta is created and the directory is prepared for initial commit.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

It is a temporary non-existant folder that allows you to decide
which files will be commited. It allows you to only commit 
relative files and leave notes for each change.
