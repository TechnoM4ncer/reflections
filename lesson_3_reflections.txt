When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When collaborating with other people or working on multiple machines from different locations.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because there may be other developers pushing commits to the remote repository.
