When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When collaborating with other people or working on multiple machines from different locations.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because there may be other developers pushing commits to the remote repository.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

A fork is a complete clone of someone else's repository on Github. It will create a
new repository on your Github that will become the origin remote when cloned locally.
Clone is used to copy a repository from a given URL to your local machine so that you
can work on it. A branch is used in order to experiment or make a different version
of the repository. It can be helpful for working with multiple developers so each
person's code does not effect the others' until they merge with master, or vice-versa.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

It will allow you to see all commits that have been pushed to the remote at any given time,
so that the repository you are working on is always current and up-to-date.
